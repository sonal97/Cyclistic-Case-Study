# Cyclistic-Case-Study

This is a case study for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.


**Scenario**

I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.

**Goal**

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
